# Differential drive controller for 6-wheeled rover.

# Wheel assignment (initial guess from URDF kinematic chains):
#   main_l (left rocker)  → wheel_1
#   sub_l chain           → wheel_2, wheel_3
#   sub2_r bogie          → wheel_4, wheel_5
#   main_r (right rocker) → wheel_6
#
# If the rover steers wrong after first launch:
#   - Drives backward when pressing forward: swap left_wheel_names and right_wheel_names
#   - Spins in place instead of going straight: adjust wheel_separation
#
# Measure actual wheel_radius and wheel_separation from the CAD / URDF geometry.
